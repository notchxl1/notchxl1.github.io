        <p>might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,</p>
        <p>by so receiving a dishonour'd life</p>
        <p>with ransom of such shame. would yet he had lived!</p>
        <p>a lack, when once our grace we have forgot,</p>
        <p>nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.</p>
